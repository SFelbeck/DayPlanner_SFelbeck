This assignment was far more difficult than I had initially determined it to be, I struggled quite a bit in javascript before a classmate pointed out that we were using jquery and at first that seemed to be a far better solution. However I was unable to finish the user input portion of the assignment. I was able to append list items to the top of the screen with a prompt but ran out of time before I could figure out the remaining steps.
My classmates were extremely useful in the stufy groups however that ultimately could not overcome the relentless march of time.
